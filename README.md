# Zhang-Shasha: Tree Edit Distance in Ruby

This `zss` module provides a utility to compute tree edit distance between
two given trees.

The algorithm is provided by Kaizhong Zhang and Dennis Shasha.

Most parts of library and test code is ported from [this Python project](https://github.com/timtadh/zhang-shasha).
